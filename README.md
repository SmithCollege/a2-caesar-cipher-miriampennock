## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?
I've always really liked Ciphers and that kind of thing, so it was fun to build my own and really understand how they worked on a code basis.

What was most challenging about this assignment?
Gradle.

General comments on your experience with this assignment:
Overall, I feel good about the actual programming of this assignment, and less good about the Gradle aspects of this project. I think I understand git classroom, but I'm not 100% certain. 

I also fixed a git merge error on my own for the first time, which is very exciting!
